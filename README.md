# Exploratory Data Analysis on the World Bank Dataset.

The main objective of this project is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis on the World Bank Dataset available through open [Web APIs](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/889392-api-documentation).

The World Bank data consists of demographic and other statistical data related to Population, Employment, Health, GDP, Energy Consumption, etc. for all the countries from the year 1960 to 2018. We have selected certain indicators for this analysis and collected the data through API calls.

* The data has been first pre-processed and cleaned.
* The cleaned data has been stored into different CSV files. For convenience, the repository contains the CSV files with the cleaned data.
